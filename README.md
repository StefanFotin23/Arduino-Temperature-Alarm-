# Arduino-Temperature-Alarm-
Arduino Temperature Alarm with real time temperature on LCD display.

The project uses 2 Arduino boards, I2C communication protocol between them, and an LCD display to show the real time temperature.
We use temperature sensors to take information from environment and use an alarm speaker with a red led to signal that we have
an emergency (temperature out of normal scope).
